# AI-Powered-College-Chatbot-
In this project, I had created an AI chatbot for hackathon program held in my college using OLLAMA.

## Objective of this project:
*  The chatbot aims to provide instant and accurate responses to common inquiries related to admissions, fees, course details, campus facilities, and more, thereby reducing the workload on administrative staff and improving the student experience.

# This project is used to:-
* Address common questions: The chatbot covers a wide range of frequently asked questions related to admission procedures, fee structures, course availability, and campus facilities.
* Free up administrative staff: By automating responses to common queries, the chatbot allows administrative staff to focus on more complex and personalized tasks.

# Technologies and Libraries Used:

`Programming Language: Python
Streamlit – UI for chatbot interface
spaCy – NLP for keyword detection
Ollama – LLM-based intelligent responses`
